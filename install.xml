Installation model

    1. by path & name
    path - absolute path to the file
    name - file name

    2. type
    * systemd-tmpfiles  - install $(project.name) to /usr/lib/systemd/tmpfiles.d/

Note: For legacy reasons, we install into /usr/share/bios/ path that is later
symlinked as /usr/share/fty/ (expected by code) during OS image generation.
Renaming it properly is a big effort to be coordinated between many components
at once.

<install>
    <item path = "/usr/share/bios/lenses" name = "zconfig.aug" package = "lib" />
</install>
